"""ECSPr directed (rectified "diode" network) solver -- the directional companion to
the undirected effective-conductance measurement in ``ecspr_graph.py``.

Each reaction edge carries a forward conductance ``g+`` and a backward conductance
``g-``. A metabolite potential field ``phi`` induces a per-edge signed potential drop
``x_e = (B phi)_e`` where ``B`` is the signed incidence (+1 at the tail, -1 at the head).
Current through an edge is *rectified*:

    i_e(x) = g+ * max(x, 0) - g- * max(-x, 0)  =  g+ * max(x, 0) + g- * min(x, 0)

so the edge conducts freely in the forward direction (``g+``) and is throttled in
reverse (``g- << g+`` for an irreversible reaction). Injecting a unit current s->t and
imposing the KKT stationarity conditions is equivalent to minimising the convex, C^1,
piecewise-quadratic energy

    E(phi) = 0.5 * sum_e [ g+ (x_e^+)^2 + g- (x_e^-)^2 ]  -  I^T phi,   I = e_s - e_t

whose unique (grounded) minimiser gives the two-terminal effective conductance

    C_eff = 1 / (phi[s] - phi[t]).

**Symmetric-limit parity.** At ``g- = g+`` the two rectified branches sum to the plain
quadratic ``0.5 x^T diag(g) x - I^T phi`` (because ``max(x,0)^2 + min(x,0)^2 == x^2``),
so the directed solve reproduces the ordinary undirected ``R_eff`` exactly. A directed
model therefore *degrades to the undirected one* precisely where direction is unknown
(ratio 1.0), and any divergence from the undirected answer is attributable to a real
forward/backward asymmetry -- never to the machinery.

**Solver.** Newton on a *smoothed* diode with an energy-Armijo line search as the
globalisation. The hard rectifier's kink at ``x_e = 0`` makes the active-set diagonal
``d`` discontinuous (``g+`` vs ``g-`` differ by up to 9 orders across the diode floor),
so on backflow-requiring axes -- where a route must push current the "wrong" way through
a near-irreversible cut -- edges that sit at ``x_e ≈ 0`` CHATTER between branches from one
iterate to the next, the Newton step cycles, and the solve stalls at a start- and
machine-dependent point (two "stable" KKT points, e.g. 0.092 vs 0.070 on one real S axis).
The cure is to replace the kink by a softplus transition of width ``δ`` (:data:`DIODE_SMOOTH_DELTA`):

    h(x) = δ·log(1 + e^{x/δ})   (smoothed max(x,0)),   σ = h'(x) = 1/(1+e^{-x/δ})
    i_e(x) = g+·h(x) + g-·(x - h(x)),   d_e(x) = i_e'(x) = g+·σ + g-·(1-σ) ∈ [g-, g+]

so the edge conductance ``d_e`` now varies SMOOTHLY through the transition (no ×1e9 jump),
the energy is strictly convex and C², and Newton converges to the UNIQUE grounded minimiser
start-independently and machine-independently. At ``g- = g+`` the smoothing is an exact
no-op (``d_e = g+`` for every ``x`` regardless of ``δ``), so the symmetric-limit parity with
the undirected ``R_eff`` still holds to machine precision -- the smoothing only ever acts on
genuinely directed edges, and its ``O(δ)`` bias there is a documented, reproducible model
choice, not solver noise. The reduced Hessian ``B^T diag(d) B`` is SPD on any connected
grounded graph; it is factored by CHOLMOD (analyse-once, refactor-per-iterate; the sparsity
pattern is topology-invariant so one symbolic factorisation is reused across a network's
Newton iterates AND its set4 axes) with a transparent ``splu`` fallback. An ADMM variant was
measured 10-100x slower and dropped.

This is a **pure primitive**: signed incidence + per-edge conductances + terminals in,
``C_eff`` out. It holds no SCADC path, reads no GEM, and does not import ``canon``.
Edge orientation and the ``g-/g+`` ratio are the caller's responsibility -- for ECSPr
they come from reaction roles (substrate -> rxn -> product) and the directionality
ensemble's per-reaction ``g_rev/g_fwd = exp(dG'/RT)`` ratio, both supplied by the SCADC
driver, never by this module.
