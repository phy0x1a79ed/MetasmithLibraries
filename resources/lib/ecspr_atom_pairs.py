"""Atom-transfer PAIRS from cached atom-mapping output: which metabolite's atoms
land in which metabolite, per element.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The bipartite met-rxn graph the solve runs on is a STAR: a reaction is a node joined
to every metabolite it touches. Eliminating that node -- which is exactly what the
Woodbury update's `_build_delta` does -- leaves a CLIQUE over every participant, so
every pair of participants gets conductance whether or not one atom passes between
them. The edge weights are atom counts, so the method looks stoichiometry-aware; the
TOPOLOGY throws the atom mapping away.

Measured on the real carbon graph: 52.8% of the reaction-induced metabolite pairs
transfer no atoms at all. On MNXR106432 (acetyl-CoA + CO2 + NADPH = pyruvate + NADP+
+ CoA) the pyruvate-NADPH channel carries ZERO carbons at conductance 0.700, while
the real one-carbon pyruvate-CO2 channel gets 0.033 -- a zero-atom channel 21x more
conductive than a real one.

The information needed to fix it already exists and is already computed. The unifier
(`20b_aam_unify.py:count_transits`) holds the substrate metabolite and the product
metabolite of each mapped atom IN THE SAME LOOP ITERATION, and then discards the
pairing into two independent role counters:

    sm = sub_mnxms[si]                       # substrate MNXM   <- the pair
    pm = prod_mnxms[j]                       # product MNXM     <- is right here
    if sm: counts[el][f"{sm}:substrate"] += 1     # and then thrown
    if pm: counts[el][f"{pm}:product"]   += 1     # away, separately

This module keeps `(sm, pm)`. Everything else is the same computation.

RE-EXTRACTION, NOT RE-MAPPING. The mapped SMILES are cached with their atom-map
numbers; nothing here runs RXNMapper or LocalMapper. This is arithmetic over a cache.

WHY A METABOLITE-LEVEL PAIR IS STILL NOT ENOUGH
-----------------------------------------------
Worth stating because it is the trap this whole design walks around. Pairing at the
METABOLITE level does not fix the stated problem. The true atom map splits
acetyl-CoA's 23 carbons by destination: atoms [0,1] -- the acetyl group -- become
pyruvate; the other 21 -- the CoA moiety -- become CoA. So acetyl-CoA -> CoA is a
GENUINE 21-carbon edge that any metabolite-level graph keeps, and a path arriving on
acetyl carbons could still leave through the CoA moiety carrying 21 carbons it never
brought. Only atom-resolved nodes deny that, which is why this module emits the atom
INDICES and not merely the counts -- the indices are what the class refinement
downstream partitions on.

WHAT IS REFUSED, AND WHY -- AND THE TWO REFUSALS THAT WERE BUGS
---------------------------------------------------------------
This module's first version refused 40% of the mapper universe and reported that as a
coverage finding about the method's reach. It was not. Two of the three refusals were
defects in THIS FILE, and they cost the atom lane 29 of the curated set4 axes:

  * `stripped` (19,930 rxns, 34.6%) was a REGEX MISMATCH, not unbalanced chemistry.
    The story told here -- "generic metabolites with no SMILES were dropped before
    mapping, so the mapper re-routed their atoms" -- describes a real phenomenon in a
    DIFFERENT file (`aam_stripped_input.tsv`), which this module never reads and which
    is disjoint from the universe it does read. The real cause: `EQ_TERM` matched
    `WATER`/`BIOMASS`, which the SMILES builder's regex does not, so the metabolite
    count exceeded the template count and every water-bearing reaction was refused.
    See `EQ_TERM`. Measured: 30,938 of 30,939 metabolites in the universe HAVE a
    canonical SMILES -- nothing was dropped for lack of structure.
  * `ambiguous_duplicate` (3,255 rxns) was 98.7% SELF-INFLICTED: the same metabolite
    twice is not an ambiguity. See `match_mols`. Only 43 were real.
  * DUPLICATE-METABOLITE reactions where two DISTINCT MNXMs share one canonical SMILES
    are genuinely ambiguous -- `pop(0)` picks between different metabolites -- and stay
    refused. That refusal is real.

The lesson worth keeping: a refusal rate is not evidence about the world until the
refusals have been read. Reporting 37.8% coverage as a property of the atom mapping,
when most of it was this file disagreeing with a regex, put a false limitation into a
report and nearly retired a set of biologically real axes. Every status here is
counted and reported so the next reader can check rather than believe.

    (k > 1). Unmatched positions get an empty list.

    WHY WEIGHTS RATHER THAN A GREEDY PICK, AND WHY NOT A REFUSAL. When two DISTINCT MNXMs

    arbitrarily between different metabolites, and the previous version REFUSED the whole
    reaction (`ambiguous_duplicate`) rather than choose. Both are wrong for the same

    contract is dilute-not-gap. Emitting each candidate at 1/k is the doubly-stochastic
    marginal of the uniform distribution over valid namings -- the honest "it is one of
    these k, we cannot say which," spread as weight instead of collapsed to a guess or a
    hole.

    THE SAME MNXM TWICE IS NOT AMBIGUOUS. `parse_equation` expands stoichiometry, so

def canonical_ranks(mol):
    """Atom -> canonical rank, invariant to how this reaction happened to write it.

    THIS IS LOAD-BEARING, AND THE OBVIOUS THING IS WRONG. `a.GetIdx()` is the index
    within THIS reaction's template molecule, and the same metabolite is not written
    the same way in every reaction. Measured over the mapper universe: 248 of 847
    carbon-bearing metabolites that appear in more than one reaction have
    INCONSISTENT idx -> canonical-rank mappings. Pyruvate (MNXM23) alone shows up
    with 3 distinct atom orderings across 63 reactions.

    So `(metabolite, GetIdx())` is not an atom -- it is a different atom depending on
    which reaction you read it from, and a graph keyed on it silently welds unrelated
    atoms together and splits identical ones apart. `CanonicalRankAtoms` is invariant
    to input ordering by construction, so `(metabolite, rank)` IS an atom.

    SANITIZE FIRST, ALWAYS. Templates come off `ReactionFromSmarts` unsanitized, so
    ring info and implicit valence are unset and `CanonicalRankAtoms` raises
    "Pre-condition Violation". That refusal was reported as `unrankable` and cost
    10,576 reactions (18.4% of the universe); sanitizing rescues 300/300 sampled.

    It must be unconditional, not a fallback. Sanitization perceives aromaticity, and
    canonical ranks depend on it -- so ranking some molecules sanitized and others raw
    would give one metabolite two rank systems and break `(met, rank)` exactly the way
    `GetIdx()` did. Doing it always also NORMALISES the kekulized-vs-aromatic spellings
    the mapper emits for the same molecule, which makes ranks agree across reactions
    that would otherwise disagree. If sanitization fails the molecule is genuinely
    unrankable and is refused.

    WHY THIS EXISTS. `no_mapping` was reported as a mapper outcome. It is not: every one
    of those 2,515 reactions has a buildable reaction SMILES and an EMPTY mapping,
    because RXNMapper's transformer accepts at most 512 tokens and these are the long
    ones -- median SMILES length 983 against the universe's 268, 97.5% over 400 chars.
    It is a context-window limit on a neural model, and it eats a BIASED sample: the
    reactions with the most and largest cofactors. `3 NADPH + 3 NADP+` blows the limit
    while contributing no sulfur at all.

    That bias is what makes this fallback sound. For a single element X most of a long
    reaction is irrelevant, and when exactly one substrate and one product carry X, with
    equal counts, conservation leaves exactly one possibility. This does not GUESS the
    pairing; it is the only pairing that exists.

    WHEN n == 1, one X atom on each side, there is a unique bijection and nothing is
    chosen: the pair is emitted at weight 1.0.

    WHEN n > 1 the metabolite pairing is still forced but the ATOM correspondence is not
    -- which of a substrate's 5 carbons becomes which of a product's 5. This used to be
    REFUSED, on the reasoning that picking one pairing (by rank order, say) would
    fabricate the very atom identity this graph is built to respect. That reasoning is
    right about PICKING and wrong about REFUSING: a refusal is a gap, and the model's
    stated contract is dilute-not-gap. So instead of picking one and instead of dropping
    the reaction, every candidate source->product pairing is emitted DILUTED by the
    fanout n -- each source atom spreads a total weight of 1.0 over its n candidate
    destinations (weight 1/n each). This is the doubly-stochastic completion, the
    maximum-entropy statement of "we know the metabolites transfer n atoms but not which
    maps to which": rows and columns of the n x n candidate matrix each sum to 1.0, so
    the per-atom margin is exactly a confident pairing's and O(n^2) edges are added, not
    the O(n!) of enumerating bijections. Nothing is fabricated because nothing is chosen;
    the uncertainty is represented as spread weight, which is what the graph then dilutes.

    The single case where MNXR104650 (sulfite reductase, `H2S + 3 NADP+ + 3 H2O = 4 H+ +
    sulfite + 3 NADPH`) severs sulfate from cysteine is exactly the n == 1 shape: one S
    in, one S out, three NADPH carrying none.

    Each emitted correspondence is a triple `(sub_rank, prod_rank, weight)`; the weight is
    the fanout dilution the atom graph multiplies onto the reaction's evidence E_r.
